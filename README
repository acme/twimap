NAME
    App::Twimap - Push your Twitter home timeline to an IMAP server

SYNOPSIS
      $ twimap twimap.conf

DESCRIPTION
    Twitter is an online social networking and microblogging service. The
    Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is an Internet standard
    protocols for e-mail retrieval from a server. This module stores your
    Twitter home timeline in a folder on an IMAP server.

    Why would you do this?

    *   Offline access to your Twitter home timeline

    *   Your email client can do message threading

    *   Use multiple devices and they sync read messages

    *   URLs are expanded

    *   Images and videos are embedded via oEmbed

    To use this application you need to create a Twitter API application on:

      https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new

    You need to use the examples/oauth_desktop.pl application distributed
    with Net::Twitter to obtain the OAuth tokens. First replace the consumer
    tokens with those of your application, then run the application and see
    oauth_desktop.dat.

    Create a twimap.conf (an example is shipped with this distribution) with
    the IMAP server details and Twitter access details.

    ... and now you can run the application as in the synopsis.
